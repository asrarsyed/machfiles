Should You Keep, Add, or Remove?
Keep:

    ahead, behind, diverged: These are very useful for remote collaboration and understanding the state of your branch relative to the remote.

    untracked, modified, staged, deleted: These are all essential for managing changes locally and staging commits.

Add:

    If you want to see merge status, consider adding options like:

        rebase = "REBASING"

        merge = "MERGING"

        These would show if you are in the middle of a merge or rebase, which could be valuable when working with branches or pull requests.

Remove or Simplify:

    conflicted: If you don’t run into merge conflicts often, you might consider removing it for simplicity.

    renamed: If renaming files isn’t something you do regularly, you can remove this to reduce clutter in the prompt.

Summary of Suggested Actions:

    Keep the ones related to the core changes in your repository: modified, staged, untracked, deleted, ahead, behind, and diverged.

    Remove or reduce some options like conflicted and renamed if you don't use them often.

    Optional: Consider adding merge and rebase for better visibility if you're working with branches and merges regularly.
